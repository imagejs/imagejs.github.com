#ImageJS

## Live at https://imagejs.github.io  !

ImageJS is a environment for image analysis in the web browser using JavaScript. Current prototype is best explored in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome Web Browser"). Note [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome Web Browser") does not need Administrative privileges to be installed.

##Availability

Best place to get it is from [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs "to get it as a web app") which will add it as a Chrome App and will make sure Chrome is being used. You can also point your Chrome web browser to <http://imagejs.org/>, which will open the index.html kept here, i.e. <http://imagejs.github.com/index.html>, which can be inspected at <https://github.com/imagejs/imagejs.github.com/blob/master/index.html>.

##Files
Only two files from this github project are needed to run ImageJS on a different location: ***index.html*** and ***imagejs.js***.

##"ImageJS doesn't do the analysis I need"

ImageJS is an environment developed to deliver image analysis modules. It is not an application that analyzes images *per se*. See [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbKBGb4EchE "introductory webcast to ImageJS") for an exemple of using modules to segment and extract features from an image. If that doesn't work for you, you could, for example, show [that webcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbKBGb4EchE "introductory webcast to ImageJS") to the computational person you want to convince to develop the analysis you need.
